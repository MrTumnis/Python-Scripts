[[Project Plan]]
To run checks across any data and print a report of the information
    - xlsx report of the checks to show validity (like the sodar --qafile option)
    - A data validation report as shown in ./examples

Choose the types of checks 
    - have a multi select box, or drop down where you can choose the columns to compare and the type of check to do?
        i.e compare the 10m wind to the 20m wind and see if the data is within +- 10% agreement or similar. 

Flag annomolies
    - 10m wind sensor is opposite from 20m wind sensor. 


QA_QC level 1 and 2


How can I allow for flexibility of data types and column names?
What types of checks and how to perform them across multiple columns?
What are the thresholds of the checks? Will it be silimar to the Sodar checks? 
Use Flask for future proofing and flexibilty?
Use React for front end or choose a simple GUI writer in python?
